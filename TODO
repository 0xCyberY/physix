0. Implement boot via UEFI. 
   Packages are in tree and build. It is believed that what is left
   is to make the changes to grub build script to install as UEFI.

1. Create process/Documentation for creating a bootable ISO Image.

2. [DONE] Break up toolchain scripts into prep(), config(), build(), and build_install().
   Just like 04-09 recipes

2.5. Move actions in 2.000-base-build-prep.sh and 2.010-directories.sh out of the 
     software group because 1. it doesn't install software, and 2. it can't not
     be accomplished by a non-priv'd user.

3. Break up 02-Base scripts into prep(), config(), build(), and build_install().
   Just like 04-09 recipes

4. For the moment, docbook zip pkgs have been repackaqged as a tar.gz
   to fit the process, but this case could be handled.

5. Needed software:
   - irc clients (hexchat, or irssi)
   - java
   - lua

6. Implement catalyst -P to pull down sources from the recipe's alternative url.

7. Implement Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

8. Implement Gnome. 
   Current Tracking branch: gnome, and the tree needs to brought up to date.
