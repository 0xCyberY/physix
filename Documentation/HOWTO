HOWTO Compile the Linux Kernel on Physix:
=========================================
make menuconfig
make
make modules
make modules_install

kinstall <version> <label>
   Example: kinstall 5.2.8 TestKernel



HOWTO Troubleshoot builds:
=========================================
All source code is stored in /opt/admin/sources.physix

The BUILDBOX directory is where all sources are compiled/built and
installed from. The BUILDBOX directory is located under sources.physix/.

The build logs for all source builds can be found under /opt/admin/logs.physix.



HOWTO Use system snapshots:
=========================================
Snapshots allow you to record the state of your root filesystem.
This enables the ability to return to that snapshot at a later time.
This is handy in cases where the system is put into a strange/broken
state.

* Record a snapshot:

  cd /opt/admin/physix
  ./catalyst -r <SNAP-NAME>


* List all recorded snapshots:

  ./catalyst -L


* List the system's current stack as it was built. This will show
  the timestamps of where snapshots were taken.

  ./catalyst -l


* Set the system back to a previous Snapshot:

  ./catalyst -d <SNAP-NAME>
  reboot


* Delete unwanted snapshots (BE CAREFUL):

  ./catalyst -D <SNAP-NAME>
