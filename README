Purpose:
==========
The Physix Project has 2 goals.
Goal 1: Physix is an Automated, Build-From-Source, Linux Distribution. 
It is derived from the Linux From scratch (LFS) technical books.
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org

Goal 2: Physix is a OS build system. 

IT IS HIGHLY RECCOMENED to use a sepperate storage device other than your host
system's. This prevents overwriting your host systems grub and rendering it
non-bootable. Also, make sure to read throught the LFS book before hand. It
will make more sense as to how this collection of scripts are organised.

IT IS HIGHLY RECCOMENED to use a sepperate storage device other than your host
system's. This prevents overwriting your host systems grubi/UEFI and rendering it
non-bootable. Also, make sure to read through the LFS book before hand. It
will make more sense as to how the system is built.

* Prepare to build:
   Edit the build.conf file. Most values can be left to default, with the exception
   of those marked as required. 

0. Disk Partitioning:
   'physix-tool -i build.config'

1. Build the temporary toolchain:
   'physix-tool -t 01-toolchain.json' 

2. Build the base systemd:
   'physix-tool -s 02-base-system.json' 

3. Configure the base system:
   'physix-tool -c 03-config-base.json'





NOTE on Test Suites:
======================
It is always a good idea to run the test suites. Several test suites encounter
expected or known failures. The failed return code is checked for and reported
by the 'check' and 'chroot_check' functions. In some cases, a 3rd argument is
provided such that the Error will be logged but will not halt the build process.

==============
Contributions are very welcome! :)
Please open an issue/task on github.
